# Signal-classification
ML and DL solutions for a binary classification of physics signals.

In this repository, you will find a jupiter notebook that explores some data, and build different solutions to achieve a classification of signal.
Those datas are the results of physics observations of ""two things"". Each file contains approximatively 50 000 samples. Each sample corresponds to 4 signals and each of them are made up of 7756 points.
So, we get data with the following shape (N, 4, 7756), with N the number of sample we have.
